	This fork of Valgrind 3.10 for FreeBSD 11.1 supports testing
	for PMDK, including the pmem-aware tool pmemcheck.
	It is not yet a complete implementation of Valgrind -
	approximately 20% of the regression tests fail.

	Valgrind barfs all over the place on setproctitle.

	This also manifests itself in a corrupted environment in
	children of child processes when --trace-children=yes is used.

	To cope correctly Valgrind must install the modified argv/envp
	pointers in the ps-strings area, and mark it as accessible.
